# Facebook Messenger for SailfishOS

The idea was taken from [Facebook Messenger Desktop](https://github.com/Aluxian/Facebook-Messenger-Desktop).
In addition, many QtWebView hacks were taken from [WebCat](https://github.com/llelectronics/webcat).

Since April the 30th, facebook deprecated the XMMP protocol for chat. SailfishOS used that protocol in order to
provide a chat client for that platform. That's why last OS update removed facebook chat.

The purpose of this proyect is to provide a chat client for SailfishOS.

Actually, the project is not usable. There are many bugs regarding the use of the WebView, many things to hack arround!.
